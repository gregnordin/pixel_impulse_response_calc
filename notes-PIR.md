Next:

- Document assumptions and calculations for ChatGPT result.
- Save figures to files?
- Save 2D result to a file.
- Use 2D single pixel result to show what multiple pixels look like.
- Do line plot of multiple pixels and superimpose appropriate shifted single pixels.
- Show line plot of point spread function and pixel rect function and convolution of them (dashed rect on top of convolved result).
- Show animation of convolution of PSF and rect function (in 2D?)?
- Put in marimo notebook.
    - Add fill factor slider.
    - Add NA slider?
    - Add wavelength selector (365, 385, 405 nm).
